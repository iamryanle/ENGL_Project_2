     		<p> <a href="http://collection.eliterature.org/2/works/wilks_tailspin.html" target="blank"><u><em>Tailspin</em></u></a> by Christine Wilks is a nonlinear work of electronic poetry that serves as a memoir of a former pilot’s experience during World War II and in his household. <em>Tailspin</em> combines visual and audio elements: throughout the narration images and videos are accompanied with audio. The work opens up with high frequency background noise, the sound of utensils scraping on plates, and a heart beating in the background that all together is overwhelming to the audience. The audio of the utensils sound very close to you and almost feel claustrophobic. The sudden ringing and siren noises allow for audiences to understand the grandfather’s condition. The audio recordings of explosions, sirens, and the horrors of war provide an immersive experience simulating the grandfather’s own experience in the war. </p>

     		<p> The reader is greeted with a page filled with scattered spirals, which are similar in form to the shape of the human ear. In order to navigate through <em>Tailspin</em>, the reader must hover over a series of spirals. Upon hovering over a spiral, text appears accomapanied with audio, moving figures, or new backgrounds, as displayed in Figures 1 and 2. There is no order to which the spirals need to be selected: however, in order to progress to subsequent "chapters" all spirals on a given page must be cleared - only then can the reader progress by clicking on the red spiral, as depicted in Figure 3. The affordances of electronic literature enable readers to experience <em>Tailspin</em> in a myriad of ways. Being a form of hover electronic literature, readers have control of the order and pace in which he/she wants to view a section of text. While Tailspin follows an overall linear path, the text in each “chapter” can be read in any order, and the path the narrative unfolds throughout each chapter is controlled by the reader. Because audio clips are played whenever a spiral is hovered, one could experience the entirety of the work without viewing the written text at all. </p>

     		<p> While <em>Tailspin</em> is nonlinear in a sense that each individual text can be read in any given order, <em>Tailspin</em> follows a generally linear path as the reader progresses through the work. Wilk's work is unique in a sense that readers have control over the order in which they can experience each chapter of the work, but work has a generally linear direction in its narration. The reader has the power to hover over each spiral in any order he/she wishes, but the reader is forced to progress onto the next chapter. The control that Wilks gives to the reader can be reflective of the grandfather’s own control of his hearing when he refuses to wear a hearing aid; on the contrary, the nature of the text, forcing the reader to continue on a linear path through its chapters, also reflects the grandfather’s lack of control over his hearing and trauma from the second World War. <strong>Overall, Wilk’s use of audio delivers a fully immersive experience that emulates the grandfather’s condition, and the use of affordances like audio and video enhances the narration of the story, providing readers with a unique, immersive experience that can only be found in electronic literature.</strong></p>
