     		<p> <em>Fitting the Pattern</em>, by Christine Wilks, is an interactive narrative following the story of a dressmaker and her daughter. The story unfolds through the use of different tools, scissors, a sewing machine, seam rippers, and needles, the reader choosing which tool to use and in consequence with the use of each tool, text appears. The narrative begins with the young daughter but then follows her and her feelings towards her mother and her dressmaking. The use of the tools continues to unveil text and also adds pieces to a template for a dress. 
			</p>
			<p> The reader is responsible for assembling the dress and the narrative, with each cut, stitch, and pin, inciting a bigger overall picture of both the dress and the emotions, thoughts, and experiences of the daughter. The author gives us the basic tools for both tasks, but leaves it up to the reader to piece everything together, making the reader an active participant beyond just reading linearly. The piece engages through sounds of cutting and sewing, along with vivid imagery and actions of dress making, something no print literature can execute. This puts the reader into the experience of making a dress, while still using text to convey the complicated thoughts, emotions, and memories of the daughter. The author presents these texts to the reader with small phrases as pictured below.

     		<p> These somewhat abstract texts allow the reader to form the narrative at their will rather than the author’s, they are allowed the creative freedom to fill in the blanks between what the text insinuates and what is missing, such as in the above example, why they live in separate cities and why her mother would be so horrified. Through knowing these smaller instances and thoughts of the daughter, the reader maintains a much broader perspective, with details coming into play throughout the entirety of the piece rather than a discrete chronological order, as how print literature is characterized. The order in which the text appears is completely dependent on what tool the reader chooses to use, further allowing for different conjectures of the text as the independently they could cause the readers to make certain judgements about the character at different times in the storyline.

     		<p> Figures 2 and 3 both give different impressions of her mother. Figure 2 portrays that she was very hardworking and kind, making beautiful dresses for her daughters and how that made the daughter feel “proud”, while the Figure 3 displays more of the judgemental side of the mother and how it has made her daughter feel inadequate. Through this ability for the reader to navigate independently the text in a nonlinear way, the content of the text can be interpreted in different ways, depending on the context of what the reader has already read.
