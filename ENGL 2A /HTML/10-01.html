     		<p> <em>10:01</em> provides a prime example of how user interaction, specifically through navigation, enhances the narrative told and fluctuates the interpretations of the work.  By consciously deciding which character the user clicks on, the user can take the character’s row, seat number, accessories, etc. into account, which potentially give insights into the character’s demeanor/background.  For example, a character sitting in the front row likely arrived late to the movie because according to popular user experience, the front row is an undesirable location to sit in the theater; clicking on this character will then reveal The un-gendered silhouettes engender ambiguity in the user while supporting the idea that upon a first glance, each member is simply a “face in the crowd” so-to-speak, enticing the reader to select the characters to lend them a sense of individuality.  This simple instance of interaction reminds users that those around him have their own troubles in life and instead simply views them as silhouettes in a movie theater, without regard for the complexities plaguing their lives – thus already conveying meaning with navigation.

     	<div class="col-sm-6">
     		<p> Further, the separation of the narrative into each individual character’s experience highlights the network of linked interactions between the audience members, as users can select neighbors to understand their perspectives of the same interaction or choose to follow the narrative in chronological order.  Deciding on the latter reveals links between incidents that happened in the movie theater, illuminating cause and effect and emphasizing the impact strangers can have on a person.  The variety of ways in which users can consume the plethora of information available to them in the digital literature offers insights into the narrative as a whole; in particular, the seemingly out-of-place inclusion of hyperlinks draws attention to the material and adds to the nonlinear/segmented structure of the narrative.  In turn, users can blaze their own path within the web of stories, drawing meanings from the comparisons and intertwined interactions they perceive according to the order of characters the user chooses.  The interaction between the user and the digital literature therefore opens <em> 10:01</em> to a variety of meanings, while also allowing the users to experience the narrative according to their own preferences and using their own intuition. </p>
