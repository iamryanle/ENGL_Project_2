     		<p> <em>10:01</em> provides a prime example of how user interaction, specifically navigation, enhances the narrative and fluctuates the interpretations of the work in differing ways.  By consciously deciding which character the user clicks on, the user can take the character’s row, seat number, accessories, etc. into account before reading the information, which potentially gives initial insights into the character’s demeanor/background.  For example, a character sitting in the back row is likely to fall asleep (according to popular user experience), but clicking on this character will then reveal not only that the man is in a wheelchair, but that the man’s dreams include war flashbacks—insinuating that the war caused him to be in a wheelchair.  The un-gendered silhouettes engender ambiguity in the user while supporting the idea that upon a first glance, each member is simply a “face in the crowd” so-to-speak, enticing the reader to select the characters to lend them a sense of individuality.  This simple instance of interaction reminds users that those around them have their own troubles in life, instead of simply viewing them as silhouettes in a movie theater, without regard for the complexities plaguing their lives – thus already conveying meaning with navigation.

		</div>
     	<div class="col-sm-6">
     		<p> Further, the separation of the narrative into each individual character’s experience highlights the network of linked interactions between the audience members, as users can select neighbors to understand their perspectives of the same interaction or choose to follow the narrative in chronological order.  Deciding on the latter reveals links between incidents that happened in the movie theater, illuminating cause and effect and emphasizing the impact strangers can have on a person.  Additionally, continuing the story one person at a time presents the overarching narrative in a non-linear manner, but allows the user to linearly follow an individual’s experience; this interesting paradox supports the theme of cause and effect amongst the movie theater audience members, because although a singular character’s story may connect, the foreshadowing of/build-up to the conclusion of the work—a bomb exploding in the theater – is missed.  However, following the story chronologically allows users to gather the hints of violence (diction in successive blurbs includes “kill,” “guns,” and “death”) and fully understand the sequence of events that led to the explosion as as well as everyone’s experience.  Because the chronological order switches between character perspectives, it induces level of disorientation within the audience that mimics the forthcoming bomb</p>

     	<div class="col-sm-6">
     		<p> Therefore, the variety of ways in which users can consume the plethora of information available to them in the digital literature offers insights into the narrative as a whole.  For instance, the seemingly out-of-place inclusion of hyperlinks draws attention to the material and adds to the nonlinear/segmented structure of the narrative.  In turn, users can blaze their own path within the web of stories, drawing meanings from the comparisons and intertwined interactions they perceive according to the order of characters the user chooses.  The interaction between the user and the digital literature therefore opens <em>10:01</em> to a variety of meanings, while also allowing the users to experience the narrative according to their own preferences and using their own intuition.
