        <p>With the technologically-focused culture of today’s society, digital media has become a prominent fixture of  contemporary literature, thus emphasizing the importance of understanding and analyzing its effects on the holistic meaning of the work. It creates a new type of experience and platform for the reader and the author, characterized by its interaction with the user, compared to physical literature, which is simply reading left to right down the page; instead, digital literature requires the reader to be an active participant, enabling decision-making within the story and the awakening the reader’s senses.  </p>
        <p> Pieces of electronic literature with this type of interaction in digital literature are <em>Fitting the Pattern</em> and <em>Tailspin</em> both by Christine Wilks, “Inanimate Alice” by Kate Pullinger and Chris Joseph, and <em>10:01</em> by Lance Olsen and Tim Guthrie. 
        <p> These pieces inherently prompt the question of how does user interaction affect how a narrative is revealed and how meaning is interpreted? After thorough research, it is apparent that due to the format of electronic media, the user can navigate the work at his own pace with more liberties to explore the work than those that come with reading physical literature, allowing its users to explore many different experiences provided by its creators; this opens a variety of interpretations from the ability of users to actively interact with the story.</p>
        </p> <em>Fitting the Pattern</em>, follows a narrative about a mother, who was a dressmaker, and her daughter, and how her daughter struggled with self confidence and pleasing her mother versus pleasing herself. This narrative unfolds as the reader interacts with a template of making a dress, with each cut and pinning unveiling new text and new connections, emotions, thoughts, and memories from the daughter’s point of view. </p>
        <p> <em> Tailspin </em> is a work of electronic poetry that serves as a memoir of a former pilot’s experience during World War II and in his household. Wilks heavily utilizes the affordances of electronic literature through the use of video and audio in her work. The user interaction of this work enables the reader to control the narration of each chapter, but in general the work follows a linear path.</p>
 		<p> Inanimate Alice is a piece of digital literature that describes the story of a 14 year old girl Alice and her mother who are in search of Alice’s father who had left for North China and hadn’t returned in two days, making them worried. The user interacts with the piece by clicking on different arrows which can lead to a slightly different storyline and has to choose between the regular and teacher’s version which affects the meaning they derive from the piece. </p>
		<p>“10:01” is a piece of digital literature that describes the actions and backgrounds of movie-goers starting 10 minutes and one second before the beginning of the movie.  The user can either select the characters manually and click through to learn their background information and current actions/thoughts or the user can proceed through the piece in a chronological order by either clicking on the arrows or the bubbles on the bottom of the page.  The blurbs for each person also include hyperlinks that allow the user to explore more about the topics discussed.</p>
		<p>Electronic literature goes beyond a linear interpretation of text with its medium allowing for the engagement of the reader to far surpass that of print literature. David Ciccoricco, writes that “the most visibly innovative quality of digital fiction is its ability to amalgamate multiple modes of text, image, sound, and video into one “surface” and accommodate the semiotic interplay that results”, this is only possible due to the electronic nature of the work. These liberties force the reader to interact with texts at a heightened level, perceiving narratives in new dimensions. This is evident in all four works of electronic literature analyzed, as each work of electronic literature allows for deep user interaction through the different affordances of electronic literature, but very much so in <em>Tailspin</em> and <em>Fitting the Pattern</em>, which combine all affordances mentioned by Ciccoricco above</p>
		<p> Narratives are much more flexible in electronic literature with the path of navigation defined by the reader rather than the author, as in print literature. The reader interacts with the narrative, unveiling texts and interactions on their own pace, often having a strong effect on the overall interpretation of the piece as a whole, as seen in <em>Tailspin</em> and <em> Fitting the Pattern</em>, both of which have user interaction that gives readers control over the pace and path of narrative development through physical interaction with the works. David Ciccoricco analyzes this relationship in his essay regarding digital fictions, writing how “whatever the order in which we read the episodes, the story emerges from the combination of its discrete elements”, relaying how no matter the author’s intent, the reader, through their own navigation, will find their own narrative and in turn meaning from the same work. The authors of digital literature revolutionize the reading experience, not only allowing for vastly more interpretations, but a new type of analysis for finding meaning in a work. Pressman writes that electronic literature employs “navigational actions that result in distinct relationships between the reader and the narrative that stimulate pressing questions about the nature of the digital literary work”. This modern literature articulates different thought processes just as it activates different thought processes in the reading experience as a whole. The reader is called to interpret literature outside of the typical scholarly frame of reference just as they are called to read the literature in a much more interactive way, causing different variations of the interpretations of work as every individual has their own perspectives to relate to a meaning. </p>
		<p> Navigation, specifically with regards to hyperlinks, significantly aids in enabling readers to take increased control over the amount of information they glean from literature and the order in which the information is disseminated.  Embedding hyperlinks within the text of the narrative affords readers several options that are not available with reading print texts – breaking the storyline to explore more about the content, continuing and returning to the link later, or simply ignoring the link altogether.  In the first case, the reader is then able to intake related data as he follows the story, creating a nonlinear sequence of material, that according to Jessica Pressman, not only allows the reader to interact with the story, but serves to demonstrate “openness and disorientation” (Pressman).  As such, Pressman argues that these effects of nonlinear organization in turn revolutionize the concept of the narrative due to the opportunity for a variation between readings of the same piece of digital literature, simply depending on the amount of information the reader chooses to access and when; specifically, this nexus of information opens the possibility of either no conclusion to the narrative (if the network is an endless loop) or an array of different conclusions, which can drastically change the themes and meaning gained from the work among readers (Pressman). Ion Manolescu identifies that user interaction by navigation additionally allows the readers to organize the given information according to his own personal preference (Manolescu, 2011).  This advantage facilitates different cognitive connections in each reader, giving readers the liberty to relate the information they chose to their own experiences and knowledge contingent upon how they chose to group the material, which inherently leads to deviations amongst interpretationsm. This is truly evident in <em> 10:01</em> and <em>Inanimate Alice</em>, where the reader is given control over how the narration is developed through hypertext. Though Manolescu eventually argues that print literature can produce this same effect, readers can leverage the ease of access of information provided by hyperlinks regardless of the order in which they are used – even simply the attention brought to hyperlinked topics – to achieve a level of freedom in interpreting texts that can only come with direct interaction with the text and conscious decisions about the material they consume (Manolescu, 2011).  With regards to the narrative, this interaction facilitates a holistic analysis of the story, as each segment could vary significantly and be experienced out of “chronological” order, but after evaluating the piece as a conglomeration of sections, the reader can gain a special appreciation for the story told by sections.</p>		
		<p> The interactivity of electronic literature forces allows for authors to provide narrations of electronic literature that utilize human senses in addition to standard visualization, as conveyed in <em> Tailspin</em>. The affordances of electronic literature allow for visual text and aids to be accompanied with sound. Sound allows for stronger engagement between a reader and a writer, because, as John F. Barber states, “sound directly engages our imaginations” (Barber) As John F. Barber argues, “sound connects and surrounds us with multiple, concurrent aspects of a single narrative”, leading to a “deeper, richer literary experience, prompted largely by the active engagement of our imaginations to express another sense or esoteric meaning, beyond visualization” (Barber). This deeper literary experience is produced through the connection and awareness of the speaker’s voice in the text. This connection between the speaker and the reader enables the speaker/author to better convey his/her message through the work. Similar to oral stories told before the advent of printing, sound allows for works of electronic literature to better resonate with readers. The echos of war and the grandfather's frustration in <em>Tailspin</em> is soundly delivered through this use of audio interaction combined with visual elements. Digital literature allows for authors to combine elements of both oral and written literature, providing readers with fully immersive experiences that strongly convey the author's message. </p>
		<p> Authors must take into account of the different forms of user interaction when electronic literature. Thus, indubitably, interacting with the piece of electronic literature is key for the reader’s experience with each reader who interacts differently with the piece deriving a different meaning and an experience unique to the individual that can’t be achieved with written literature; the users can only interact by reading. This is strongly supported by Noah Wardrip-Fruin, a professor in the Computational Media department of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who argues, “The main components of the model are the surface of the work (what the audience sees) and the space of possible interactions with the work” (Wardrip-Fruin). </p>
		<p> Overall, it is evident that user interaction is critical to the reader in deriving meaning from works of electronic literature. User interaction is significant in allowing the writer to provide the user with an immersive, unique experience.</p>
