     		<p> Inanimate Alice, by Kate Pullinger and Chris Joseph, from Electronic Literature Collection 1, discusses the story of an 8-year old child who was on a journey to find her father after not having seen for two days, which worried her. After knowing that her dad went up north in China to find oil in his jeep and didn’t return, Alice goes looking for her dad with her mother Ming from base camp, where they are located and eventually find him. </p>

     		<p> This electronic writing piece also uses a lot of affordances such as different types of music, happy and sad, to reflect the feelings experienced by Alice at different times which shows she is rather confused and engages the reader. The piece also uses images to engage the readers into the story further in what one could argue is pretty dull. There are other ways in which Inanimate Alice offers users the opportunity to interact too. The user has to click arrows to move forward in the story. There are times when clicking the arrows alone won’t help you move forward in the story, and the user has to click instead on images relevant that may be nearby. Readers can go through the story at their own pace and can also return back to the story by clicking on the relevant sections and the icons on the right side.

 			<p> In addition, there is the hand that the users can click on from which they can choose different directions, each of which takes the reader to a slightly different storyline. This, in some way, makes the reader empowered to make their own decisions by being able to decide the storyline that they want to be reading according to their taste, thereby emphasizing the importance of user interaction and how it helps different users arrive at meanings unique to themselves, something which is difficult to achieve with written or printed literature.</p>
